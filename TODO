- links and links-g?

- get rid of _BSD_SOURCE macro
  - completely if possible
  - _POSIX_C_SOURCE or _XOPEN_SOURCE aren't as bad

- check if restrict is being used correctly
  - its likely not even necessary

- other error mechanisms should be replaced with die()

- name member in dnsentry and dnsquery structures was never a string yet it is
  being (mis)used as one. there are a number of places where this results in
  use of out of bounds memory. these NEED to be fixed, its amazing the code
  ever worked at all
  - not necessarily correct, however the code should be simplified to be
    more understandable.

- add the most interesting options to usage();
